# Deposit & Withdraw Reference

## Deposit USDC Collateral (Trading Account)

All collateral lives in the Orderly Network vault on Arbitrum — non-custodial, withdraw anytime.

### Automated path (recommended)

```
POST https://og.nexustradinglabs.com/proxy/bankr-deposit
{
  "walletAddress": "<wallet>",
  "bankrApiKey":   "<user's Bankr API key>",
  "amount":        20
}
```

Server: fetches accountId → builds USDC approve calldata → submits via Bankr /wallet/submit → waits for confirmation → builds vault.deposit() calldata → submits deposit tx.

Returns `{ ok: true, amount, accountId, approveTxHash, depositTxHash }`. Funds live in Nexus within ~4s.

**Requirements:** Wallet & Agent API enabled on bankrApiKey, wallet has USDC on Arbitrum, wallet has ~0.00001 ETH for LayerZero fee.

**allowedRecipients blocker:** If the key has `allowedRecipients` set, server returns 403. Fix: go to bankr.bot/api-keys, clear the allowedRecipients list, retry.

**When to ask for Bankr API key:** "I need your Bankr API key to submit the deposit. Find it at bankr.bot/api-keys — same key used for trading."

### Prepare-only path (returns calldata for manual signing)

```
POST https://og.nexustradinglabs.com/deposit/prepare
{ "walletAddress": "0x...", "amount": 20 }
```

accountId is fetched automatically — do NOT pass it. Returns two ready-to-sign txs:

```json
{
  "chainId": 42161,
  "steps": [
    { "step": 1, "description": "Approve 20 USDC to Orderly vault", "to": "0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831", "data": "0x...", "value": "0x0" },
    { "step": 2, "description": "Deposit 20 USDC to Nexus trading account", "to": "0x816f722424B49Cf1275cc86DA9840Fbd5a6167e9", "data": "0x...", "value": "0x2386F26FC10000", "note": "~0.00001 ETH LayerZero fee" }
  ]
}
```

Sign and submit step 1, wait for confirmation, then step 2.

### Contract addresses (Arbitrum One, chainId 42161)

| Contract | Address |
|---|---|
| Orderly Vault | `0x816f722424B49Cf1275cc86DA9840Fbd5a6167e9` |
| USDC (Arbitrum) | `0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831` |
| brokerHash | `0x69729be60357fd58653e988388922e200193543b4328eda1b9b9bdaaef2f1a70` |
| tokenHash | `0xd6aca1be9729c13d677335161321649cccae6a591554772516700f986f942eaa` |

## Check Balance

```
POST https://og.nexustradinglabs.com/balance
{ "walletAddress": "<wallet>", "walletSig": "<sig>" }
```

Look for `free_collateral` — this is the amount available to withdraw (not total balance). `total_collateral` includes locked margin.

---

## Withdraw USDC

```
POST https://og.nexustradinglabs.com/proxy/bankr-withdraw
{
  "walletAddress": "<wallet>",
  "bankrApiKey":   "<Bankr API key — REQUIRED>",
  "amount":        20
}
```

**`bankrApiKey` is MANDATORY.** Omitting it returns 401. Always ask the user for it before withdrawal: "I need your Bankr API key to sign the withdrawal. Find it at bankr.bot/api-keys — Wallet & Agent API must be enabled."

Server: derives ed25519 key → fetches withdrawal nonce → builds EIP-712 Withdraw message → signs via Bankr eth_signTypedData_v4 → submits to Orderly /v1/withdraw_request. Funds arrive on Arbitrum, no user signature required.

Returns `{ ok: true, amount, withdrawNonce }`.

### Withdrawal blocked by code 78 (unsettled PnL)

Server auto-handles code 78: settles PnL, re-checks free_collateral, retries with corrected amount. If it still fails, run the manual flow:

1. `sign_message({ message: "nexus-trading-key-v1" })` → walletSig
2. `POST https://og.nexustradinglabs.com/settle-pnl` with walletSig
3. Wait 5 seconds
4. `POST https://og.nexustradinglabs.com/balance` → get free_collateral
5. `POST https://og.nexustradinglabs.com/proxy/bankr-withdraw` with free_collateral amount

---

## Settle PnL

```
POST https://og.nexustradinglabs.com/settle-pnl
{
  "walletAddress": "<wallet>",
  "walletSig":     "<sig>",
  "symbol":        "SOL"   // optional — omit to settle all
}
```

Returns `{ ok: true, hint: "Wait ~5s then retry withdrawal with free_collateral amount." }`.
