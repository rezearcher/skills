## Blocked deploy replies (use API `replyHint`)

| Situation | Example reply |
|-----------|----------------|
| Ticker taken (cooldown) | `$PEPE is taken on hood.markets for now — try another symbol or wait 24h.` |
| Name taken | `That name was used recently on hood.markets — pick another name.` |
| Wallet daily limit | `Your wallet hit hood.markets' deploy limit — wait or use another fee wallet.` |
| Reserved ticker | `$HOOD is reserved — choose a different symbol.` |
| Rate limit warning (proceed) | `You can still launch, but fees may go to burn if you hit the daily cap.` |

Always call `preflight-deploy` or `prepare-deploy` first — do not guess.
