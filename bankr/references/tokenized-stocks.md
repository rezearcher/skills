# Tokenized Stocks Reference

Trade tokenized stocks and ETFs — real-world equities issued as on-chain tokens — with a plain prompt, the same way you trade any other asset on Bankr.

## Venues

Bankr supports tokenized stocks across four venues. When you ask for a stock by ticker, Bankr resolves the best venue automatically; name the chain or venue to force a specific one.

| Venue | What you get | Examples | Location verification |
|-------|--------------|----------|-----------------------|
| Robinhood Chain | Spot tokens issued by Robinhood (stocks + ETFs) | NVDA, AAPL, TSLA, SPY, QQQ | **Required** |
| Solana | Spot tokens from third-party issuers (e.g. xStocks) | AAPLx, TSLAx | Not required |
| Base | Spot tokens from third-party issuers | varies by listing | Not required |
| Avantis (Base) | Leveraged equity perpetuals (long/short) | NVDA, TSLA, HOOD, META | Not required |

Stock **perpetuals** (leveraged long/short exposure rather than spot ownership) are also available on Hyperliquid via HIP-3. See [leverage-trading.md](leverage-trading.md) and [hyperliquid.md](hyperliquid.md).

```
"buy $100 of NVDA on robinhood"
"buy $50 of AAPLx on solana"
"long TSLA with 5x leverage on avantis"
"short HOOD on hyperliquid"
```

## Robinhood Chain (spot)

Robinhood Chain hosts 95+ tokenized stocks and ETFs issued by Robinhood — large caps (NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN), ETFs (SPY, QQQ, SOXX), and pre-IPO names.

```
"buy $100 of NVDA on robinhood"
"swap $50 of ETH to SPY on robinhood"
"sell half my AAPL on robinhood"
"send $30 of AAPL to @friend on X"
```

Prices track the underlying equity. Trades settle on-chain against **USDG (Global Dollar)**, Robinhood Chain's native stablecoin — Bankr routes through it automatically, so you can fund a purchase from ETH, USDG, or any token on the chain in a single command.

Stocks work with automations too:

```
"every monday, analyze the tokenized stock market and put $100 into your strongest pick"
"DCA $50 into SPY every friday"
```

### Location verification

Robinhood tokenized stocks are **not available in the US, UK, sanctioned countries or regions, or any jurisdiction where they are prohibited by local law**. This is the only Bankr feature that requires location verification.

1. Log in to the [Bankr console](https://bankr.bot). Your location is verified automatically from your connection — there are no forms and nothing to upload.
2. Once verified, you can trade Robinhood stocks from any platform — X, Telegram, the console, or the API.
3. Verification expires after 30 days. Logging in to the console again renews it.

If you attempt a stock trade before verifying (or after your verification lapses), the trade is blocked and Bankr asks you to log in to the console first. Only Robinhood stock trades are gated — memecoins on Robinhood Chain, bridging, and transfers work without verification. Over the Wallet API, a swap involving a Robinhood tokenized stock without a passed location check returns `403` with instructions to verify.

## Solana and Base (spot)

Tokenized stocks from third-party issuers — such as xStocks (AAPLx, TSLAx, and others) on Solana — trade like any other token on those chains. No location verification is required; standard swap, limit order, and DCA commands all work:

```
"buy $50 of AAPLx on solana"
"swap 1 SOL to TSLAx"
```

Liquidity for these tokens lives in regular AMM pools and varies by listing — Bankr quotes real executable prices, so thin markets surface in your quote. Verify you're trading the canonical issuer's token: ask Bankr for the token's details before trading if you're unsure.

## Leveraged stocks (perps)

For leveraged long/short exposure to equities — without owning the underlying token — Bankr integrates **Avantis** (perpetuals on Base) and **Hyperliquid**. Avantis lists equity pairs such as NVDA, TSLA, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, META, COIN, and HOOD alongside its crypto, forex, and commodity markets.

```
"long TSLA with 5x leverage on avantis"
"short $50 of NVDA on avantis"
"close my HOOD position"
```

No location verification is required for perps. Equity perpetuals only trade during the underlying market's hours — orders placed while the market is closed will fail. See [leverage-trading.md](leverage-trading.md) for position management, take-profit/stop-loss, and margin details.

## Which venue should I use?

- **Own the asset on an EVM chain with deep coverage** → Robinhood Chain (verification required)
- **Own the asset on Solana without verification** → xStocks
- **Leveraged or short exposure, no ownership** → Avantis (Base) or Hyperliquid perps

## Regional availability & risk

Robinhood tokenized stocks are unavailable in the US, UK, and sanctioned countries and regions. Availability of third-party issuer tokens on Solana and Base is subject to the issuer's own terms. Nothing here is investment advice; tokenized equities carry issuer and market risks in addition to normal on-chain risks.
