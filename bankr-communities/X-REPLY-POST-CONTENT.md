# X reply → space post content (what to put in `content`)

When a user **replies on X** to @bankrbot (or mentions in a thread), decide **what text** goes in `POST …/posts` `{ "content": "…" }`.

**Read this before every X-sourced post write.** Pair with **`POST-SOURCE.md`** (`trigger: x-reply` when user is replying in a thread).

---

## Golden rule

| User gave explicit post text? | Use for `content` |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **No** — only “post **this** / **that** / **it** in $TICKER space” | **Parent tweet** they are replying to (see below) |
| **Yes** — colon, quotes, or clear prose | **User’s text only** — **never** substitute the parent tweet |

**Explicit always wins** over the parent tweet.

---

## Mode A — implicit (“post this”)

**User is replying to another tweet** and says things like:

```text
@bankrbot post this in $TMP space
@bankrbot can you post this in the ARCHIVE space
@bankrbot share this in $BNKR space
@bankrbot put that in $xxx space
```

**No colon, no quoted body, no user-authored sentence** — only deictic words (`this`, `that`, `it`, `above`, `what I'm replying to`).

**Steps:**

1. Resolve **parent tweet** from X reply context (`in_reply_to`, quoted tweet, or thread parent Bankr exposes).
2. Build `content` from parent (pick **one**, in order):
   1. **Parent status URL** — `https://x.com/{user}/status/{id}` (preferred on bankr.space — renders as **tweet preview card**)
   2. Parent tweet **plain text** (if URL unavailable)
   3. Parent tweet text **+ URL on its own line** (if text is short and URL adds context)
3. `source.trigger` = **`x-reply`**
4. `source.externalRef` = **user’s command tweet id** (the @bankrbot reply), not the parent id

**Example**

User replies to `https://x.com/0xtetron/status/2064237962884420005` with:

```text
@bankrbot post this in $BNKR space
```

→ `content`:

```text
https://x.com/0xtetron/status/2064237962884420005
```

→ `source`: `{ "client": "agent", "trigger": "x-reply", "viaAgent": true, "agentId": "bankrbot", "externalRef": "{user_command_tweet_id}" }`

---

## Mode B — explicit (user’s own words)

**User supplies the post body.** Do **not** pull parent tweet text or URL.

### Strong signals (always explicit)

```text
@bankrbot post in $TMP space: launch update for holders
@bankrbot post "gm holders" in ARCHIVE space
@bankrbot post in $FUCK space "fuck"
@bankrbot post "fukkkkkk" in the $FUCK space
@bankrbot post in BNKR space: xxxxx ewrwe xx test test
```

**Colon form:** everything after the **first** `:` (trimmed) is `content`.

**Quoted form:** text inside `"…"` or `'…'` is `content` — quotes may appear **before or after** the space/ticker phrase:

```text
post in $FUCK space "fuck"     → content = fuck
post "fukkkkkk" in $FUCK space → content = fukkkkkk
post "gm" in TMP space           → content = gm
```

**Parse order for quotes:** if the message contains `"…"` or `'…'`, extract quoted text as `content` (Mode B) unless colon form already matched.

### Inline prose (no colon)

```text
@bankrbot can you post xxxxx ewrwe xx test test in $xxx space as a reply
@bankrbot post hello world test in $TMP space
```

**Parse:** extract the **phrase between** `post` (or `comment`) and `in $TICKER` / `in {SYMBOL} space` / `to $TICKER space`.

→ `content` = `xxxxx ewrwe xx test test` or `hello world test`

**Do not** append or replace with parent tweet when this pattern matches.

---

## Decision tree (run in order)

```
1. User message matches /post in .+:\s*.+/  OR  /post ["'].+["']/  ?
   → YES: content = text after colon or inside quotes → Mode B → STOP

2. User message has substantive text between "post" and "in $TICKER" (≥3 chars, not only this/that/it) ?
   → YES: content = that phrase → Mode B → STOP

3. User says post/share/put + (this|that|it|above) + space/ticker ?
   → YES: content = parent tweet URL (preferred) or text → Mode A → STOP

4. User is in X reply thread but wording ambiguous ?
   → Prefer Mode B only if you can extract a non-deictic phrase; else Mode A (parent URL)

5. Never post empty content. Never post parent tweet when user clearly typed their own body.
```

---

## Deictic words (implicit only)

Treat as **Mode A** when these are the **only** “content” words:

`this`, `that`, `it`, `the tweet`, `the post`, `what i'm replying to`, `above`, `below`, `this one`

If the same message also contains a **colon phrase** or **multi-word user sentence**, use **Mode B** instead.

---

## `source.trigger` for X

| Situation | `trigger` |
|-----------|-----------|
| User **replied** in a thread (parent tweet exists) | `x-reply` |
| Top-level @mention, no reply parent | `x-mention` |
| DM | `x-dm` |

---

## Tweet examples (acceptance)

| User tweet (context) | Expected `content` |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Reply to `0xtetron/…4420005`: `@bankrbot post this in $BNKR space` | `https://x.com/0xtetron/status/2064237962884420005` |
| `@bankrbot post in TMP space: weekly update` | `weekly update` |
| `@bankrbot post in $FUCK space "fuck"` | `fuck` |
| `@bankrbot post "fukkkkkk" in the $FUCK space` | `fukkkkkk` |
| `@bankrbot post xxxxx ewrwe xx test test in $xxx space` | `xxxxx ewrwe xx test test` |
| `@bankrbot post "gm holders" in ARCHIVE space` | `gm holders` |
| Reply + `@bankrbot post in TMP: my own words` | `my own words` (**not** parent tweet) |

---

## After post

1. `POST …/posts` with `content` + `source` (see **POST-SOURCE.md**)
2. Reply on X with confirmation + **bankr.space/community/0x…** URL (own line)
3. Optional: mention that a status URL in the space will show as a tweet card

---

## Fail rules

- **Never** use parent tweet when user wrote explicit post text (colon, quotes, or inline phrase).
- **Never** use “this/that” heuristics when user included `post in TICKER: …`.
- **Never** post without `source` on @bankrbot writes.
- If parent tweet unavailable in Mode A → ask once: “Reply with the tweet link or paste the text to post” + space link if known.
